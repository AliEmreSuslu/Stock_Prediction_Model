Stock Price Prediction

Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network, for predicting stock prices. The notebook guides you through the process of fetching historical stock data, preparing the data for training, developing an LSTM model, and evaluating its performance.
Features

    Data fetching from Yahoo Finance using yfinance.
    Data preprocessing and normalization.
    Model development with TensorFlow's Keras API.
    Visualization of stock prices and prediction results.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    TensorFlow
    yfinance
    NumPy
    pandas
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn
    scikit-learn

Installation

To run this project, you will need to install the required Python libraries. You can install them using the following command:

bash

pip install tensorflow yfinance numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Usage

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed to open .ipynb notebooks.
    Navigate to the notebook directory and launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
    Open the Stock_price_prediction_with_LSTM.ipynb notebook.
    Run the cells in sequence to fetch the data, train the model, and view the predictions.

Model Development

The notebook contains detailed steps for developing the LSTM model, including:

    Fetching historical stock data using yfinance.
    Data preprocessing steps such as normalization.
    Building and training the LSTM model.
    Visualizing the prediction results compared to actual stock prices.
